## Abu Dhabi
Welcome to our meeting place where travelers from all over the world receive a warm greeting and experience the respect of the residents of the United Arab Emirates.

Hospitality lies in the very heart of Arabian culture. Visitors today experience a welcome unmatched anywhere else, from the traditional serving of Arabic coffee to an absolute dedication of the highest standards of modern service.

Abu Dhabi‘s unique charm is reflected in the blend of ancient 19th century traditions and modern 21st century economy and lifestyle. Old world courtesies still prevail and traditional
culture is very much alive. Visitors can see craftsmen demonstrating ancient skills or experience camel riding, falconry, ayallah dancing, and henna painting, and can learn about age-old customs from local people who enthusiastically share their traditions.

Some of these are Eid Al Fitr (three days), Eid Al Adha (four days) and Al Hejra (one day). Fixed dates on the calendar are New Year’s Day (Jan 1) and UAE National Day (Dec 2).

## FAQs

### Do I need a visa to visit Abu Dhabi?
Citizens of GCC countries do not require a visa or permit or to be sponsored by a national or resident in the UAE. They need to produce their GCC country passport or national ID card at the point of entry into the UAE. [Citizens of these countries](...) do not require advance visa arrangements to enter the UAE and can obtain a visa upon arrival for 30 days with a 10-day grace period for extension. [Citizens of these countries](...) do not require advance visa arrangements to enter the UAE and can obtain a visa upon arrival for 90 days. More information about other passports is available [here](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/do-you-need-an-entry-permit-or-a-visa-to-enter-the-uae).

### What should I wear in Abu Dhabi?
Due to the Islamic codes of modesty in Abu Dhabi, there is always a mixture of Western and Arabic styles. Dressing modestly is a sign of respect for the culture and is especially important during Ramadan (the Islamic holy month). Women are basically free to dress as they please, however, tight and revealing clothing would be considered disrespectful to local custom. Sleeves of any length are preferable to sleeveless blouses and dresses. Lightweight summer clothing is appropriate for most of the year. There is no requirement for women to cover their heads, unless visiting a mosque. Because the air conditioning is strong in restaurants, hotels, and other indoor venues, jackets, sweaters and wraps are useful. When visiting government offices, it is best to cover arms and legs. For the beach, while items like shorts, sleeveless shirts and two-piece women's swimsuits are acceptable at the beach itself, we would recommend bringing an outfit with more coverage if you will be leaving the beach or using public transport to get to and from the beach.

### What is the weather like in the UAE?
Abu Dhabi has a sub-tropical climate. November to March is the most appealing season, and this is also when infrequent winter rains occur. The temperature range in the winter months is between 56º F (13º C) and 75º F (24º C) with typically bright sunny days which correspond to the best kind of spring weather in the US. Summer temperatures range from a low of around 65º F (18º C) to over 115º F (46º C) and the humidity may be high.


### What is the timezone?
Abu Dhabi is GMT+4.


### Should I follow certain customs when visiting?

The UAE is an Islamic country which is a dominant fact of life for the local Emirati population and flavors everyday life for Abu Dhabi’s other residents as well. Much like any cosmopolitan metropolis, both street and pedestrian traffic are lively, as Emiratis and expatriates from around the globe frequent shopping malls, restaurants, sports facilities, and the waterfront area known locally as the Corniche. Despite what may be thought to prevail in other Middle Eastern countries, women should face few if any problems when traveling in the UAE.

Guidebooks and conversations with colleagues offer many suggestions for polite and appropriate behavior in Abu Dhabi. For example, learn a selection of Arabic phrases and use them when greeting new people.
<!-- When you are seated, make sure the sole of your foot is not pointing directly at anyone, as this would be insulting. Use your right hand to offer an item to another person or to receive items. For example, offer your business card with your right hand; you can receive one with both hands. The business week is Monday through Friday. -->

Add few nice Arabic phrases here....

| English | Pronunciation |  عربي |
|------|-------|-------|
| Hello | as-salamu alaykum | السلام عليكم|
|      |  marhaba | مرحبا|
 

### What's an LGBTQI+ identifying person's experience like in the UAE?
Policies in the UAE vary by Emirate. In Abu Dhabi, there are no LGBTQ-specific laws except for prohibitions on cross-dressing. However, the prohibition is rarely enforced.

### What about public displays of affection?
The culture of the UAE puts a lot of value on discretion and modest behavior in public spaces. 
Public displays of affection between couples of all orientations and genders are generally discouraged.

### Is Abu Dhabi dangerous?
Overall, Abu Dhabi’s general crime level remains very low. Random, violent criminal acts are extremely rare. As in any other city, you should be cognizant of your surroundings and personal safety as you travel. Dress appropriately, and respect the cultural mores by avoiding public displays of affection. Most public areas are well-lit at night, and most public buildings tend to be relatively safe. Crowds are generally nonthreatening and political demonstrations must have governmental approval.


### How can I travel around the city?
An inexpensive bus service serves Abu Dhabi, and is operated by the Abu Dhabi Municipality. There are city-wide bus routes, with stops in many residential areas. Taxi service is inexpensive relative to other similar cities; the law requires drivers to use their meters. Taxis are usually available at hotels and malls. Depending on the time of day and rush hour conditions, taxi service can be sporadic. Drivers generally speak some English; be sure your driver knows exactly where you wish to go. 


### Which plugs do I use?
Voltage in Abu Dhabi is 220/240. North American electric shavers, hair dryers, and electric toothbrushes are known to break with the higher voltage and it is therefore advisable to purchase new ones once you are in the region. Computers, cell phones, and Blackberries all have voltage converters built into them, but you may need to use physical plug adapters. Adapters are also available at grocery stores and electronics stores.

### Can I drink in the UAE?
The legal drinking age in the UAE is 21, except in the Emirate of Sharjah, where alcohol consumption is illegal. Being intoxicated in public is not permitted. Abu Dhabi has a zero tolerance policy, and there are severe fines and penalties for those caught driving while under the influence. 


### Does everyone speak English?
Although Arabic is the official business language, English is widely used in Abu Dhabi. Signs for roads, shops, and restaurants are written in both languages. Urdu and Hindi are also widely spoken.


### Is Abu Dhabi an accessible city?
In the UAE, people with special needs or disabilities are referred to as ‘people of determination’ to recognize their achievements in different fields. Especially in recent years, the UAE government has worked hard to ensure that modern areas and establishments such as cultural sites, hotels, restaurants are fitted with adaptations and services for people of determination. Parking lots include designated spots, public spaces have been updated with proper facilities, and ramps are increasingly commonplace outside public buildings.
